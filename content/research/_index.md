Abstract: Studies based on natural experiments find that consumption responds strongly and significantly to a transitory variation in income, while semistructural estimations find no pass-through of transitory shocks to consumption. I develop a more robust semistructural estimator that relaxes the assumption that log consumption is a random walk. The robust pass-through estimate is significant and large, implying a yearly marginal propensity to consume of 0.32, close to the natural experiment findings. The robust estimator performs well in numerical simulations of a life cycle model, while nonrobust estimators do not. The difference between the two in the simulations is similar to their difference in the survey data.

Abstract: In the United States, after age 65, households face income and health risks, and a large fraction of these risks are transitory. While consumption significantly responds to transitory income shocks, out-of-pocket medical expenses do not. In contrast, both consumption and out-of-pocket medical expenses respond to transitory health shocks. Thus, most US elderly keep their out-of-pocket medical expenses close to a satiation point that varies with health. Consumption responds to health shocks mostly because adverse health shocks reduce the marginal utility of consumption. The effect of health on marginal utility changes the optimal transfers due to health shocks.

Abstract: The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a central object in economics that is key to understand the transmission of shocks. Recent empirical findings challenge the standard view that its distribution is mostly explained by constraints on liquid wealth: (i) some people with substantial liquid wealth have a high MPC; (ii) higher current earnings, which should relax the constraints, do not reduce the MPC. I note that, in the standard consumption model, it is the combination of peopleâ€™s liquid wealth and the variance of their future earnings that determines their precautionary motive and constraints, thus their MPC. Everything else being equal, a higher permanent component of earnings, means a higher variance of future earnings and a higher MPC. This can explain (i)-(ii). Survey data support a large and positive effect of permanent earnings on the MPC. Numerical simulations can replicate those findings quantitatively in a model with realistic earnings risk.

<li> On the Concavity of Consumption in the Permanent
Component of Earnings

Abstract: The extent to which people consume and save out of their resources matters to understand wealth accumulation. The result that consumption is concave in accumulated wealth has been extremely influential. However, the reason for the concavity relates to the fact that accumulated wealth is safe and reduces precautionary saving. The same result thus might thus not apply to risky human capital, which represents a large share of total expected resources. In this paper, I prove that consumption is also concave in the permanent component of earnings, that scales human capital. The mechanism is the opposite that the one behind the concavity in wealth: at a higher level of permanent earnings, the precautionary saving motive is stronger, and more sensitive to variations in permanent earnings.
